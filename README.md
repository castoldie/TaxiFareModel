## Development Process

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
 - Data Collection: Data collected from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission.
 - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the data.
 - Feature Engineering: Creating new features that can help improve model accuracy.
### Model Development
 - Model Selection: Evaluating different machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.
 - Training: Training the model using libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.
 - Evaluation: Using metrics like RMSE to evaluate model performance.
### API and Frontend Integration
 - API Development: Creating a FastAPI application to serve the model predictions.
 - Frontend Development: Building a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend to interact with the API.
